## Leaderboard 心动指南针排行榜

### Overview
  A leaderboard and management system I created for an activity held by a Chinese student organization at NYU. 
  
  > Rankings of each group are computed at the backend by comparing scores and then saved to the database. 
  > Top 5, top 10, top 20 and the rest of the groups are catogrized by different ui elements.
  
  > group managers can update group names and group profiles.
  > administrators can update scores of each team.
